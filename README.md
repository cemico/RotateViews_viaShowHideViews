## Synopsis

Very simple example of using show / hide to render a different storyboard view when orientation changes.  This is a demo app to compare against another demo app which implements this functionality with show / hiding the view, i.e., RotateViewIntoNewView_viaChildContainer.

## Motivation

Explore the differences in handling rotation events which need to render a different storyboard screen.
